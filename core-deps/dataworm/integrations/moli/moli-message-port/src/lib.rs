//! Renderer-neutral MessagePort registry.
//!
//! This crate owns the MessagePort state that does not need V8, JavaScript
//! wrappers, pages, workers, or task queues:
//!
//! - port id allocation;
//! - entangled peer tracking;
//! - pending message and close queues;
//! - transfer detach/attach owner state;
//! - close-after-active-delivery behavior.
//!
//! Payload and owner wake types are supplied by the embedding layer. The
//! renderer crate uses structured-clone bytes as the payload and page/worker
//! wake handles as the owner.
