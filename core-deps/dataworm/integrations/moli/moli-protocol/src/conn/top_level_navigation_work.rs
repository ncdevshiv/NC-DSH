/// rescans mutable Page state. The action retains both identities needed at its
/// eventual turn:
///
/// - `page_owner` rejects execution after Page replacement or retirement;
/// - `owner_scope` restores the target route used by an implicit (`None`)
///   session instead of resolving whichever target is current later.

/// The source Document remains inside `navigation` as causal metadata. A
/// same-Page `document.open()` replacement therefore does not manufacture a
/// new request, while replacement of the Page residence makes the action
/// stale.
