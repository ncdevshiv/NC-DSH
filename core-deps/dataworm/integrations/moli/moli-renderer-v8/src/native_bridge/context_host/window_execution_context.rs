//! Registry-backed Window realms and Window-owned asynchronous work.
//!
//! The submodules deliberately keep three concepts separate:
//!
//! - `registry` is the authority for realm ownership and access policy;
//! - `binding` is a stable ScriptState-like reference to one registered realm;
//! - `operation_receiver` freezes and authorizes a Window receiver before
//!   WebIDL conversion can run author code;
//! - `fetch` couples that realm to the LocalWindow whose request lifetime it
//!   follows.
//!
//! In particular, a binding is never rewritten to point at another Window.
