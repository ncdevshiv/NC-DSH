//! DedicatedWorker setup and payload support for renderer fixtures.
//!
//! This module may create an exact producer or a structured-clone payload, but
//! it deliberately has no dequeue, authorization, body execution, or task
//! completion authority. Complete DedicatedWorker task tests must use the
//! shared Page selected-task harness and production dispatcher.
