//! Task completion for one selected main-parser continuation.
//!
//! Parser-deferred classic and module work can arrive through more than one
//! production carrier, but they share one HTML-task boundary. Their bodies
//! report whether page code or an event-dispatch body was entered; this
//! component alone maps that execution fact to the parser task-end checkpoint.
//! The fact is produced only after execution and is never stored in a queue or
//! used as scheduler policy.
//!
//! This completion deliberately does not execute another Page task. Work made
//! ready by script reactions is published to stable sources, while an exact
//! DOMContentLoaded successor may be consumed separately by `ParserCompletion`
//! without reopening ordinary scheduler arbitration.
