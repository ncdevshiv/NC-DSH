//! Completion boundary for selected Page callback tasks.
//!
//! Callback bodies such as `Window.postMessage` have one established
//! post-dispatch sequence that is longer than a plain task-end checkpoint:
//!
//! 1. run the agent microtask checkpoint while the callback's relevant Window
//!    dispatch scope is still active;
//! 2. synchronize child browsing-context records created or replaced by the
//!    callback and its Promise reactions;
//! 3. reconcile runtime-script follow-up produced by that same callback;
//! 4. perform the runtime/style turn-exit cleanup.
//!
//! Keeping this sequence behind one coordinator prevents individual callback
//! families from moving child/runtime reconciliation before the checkpoint or
//! forgetting it entirely. It is not a scheduler lane and does not select,
//! drain, or prioritize another Page task.
