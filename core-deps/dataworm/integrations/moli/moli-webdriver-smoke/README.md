# moli-webdriver-smoke

This is a standalone WebDriver smoke project for moli. It is a peer of
`moli-cdp-smoke/`: the runner starts a local fixture server, starts
`moli serve`, and exercises the public WebDriver wire surface from outside
the Rust test harness.

The default suite runs every Moli group: raw WebDriver Classic HTTP, raw BiDi
WebSocket messages, Selenium Python's `webdriver.Remote` client, cross-engine
semantics and navigation contracts, Moli's URL policy, and renderer-IO script
interruption. This covers both protocol-level wire shape and real Selenium
client workflows without requiring a group allowlist.

The `semantics` group contains isolated cross-engine contracts. It can
run against Moli's native WebDriver endpoint or an external ChromeDriver;
Moli uses standard W3C capabilities without Chrome vendor options.

The `url-policy` group is a Moli hosted-product contract. It
uses isolated Classic and BiDi sessions to verify the exact local-file
navigation error envelopes, unchanged browsing contexts, and absence of BiDi
navigation lifecycle events. It is deliberately skipped for desktop Chromium,
whose browser-granted local-file capability is a different product policy.

The `navigation-errors` group is a cross-engine Chromium/WPT contract.
It runs the same 37-case public-wire matrix against Moli or ChromeDriver:
ten Classic malformed-body/URL cases, 22 BiDi invalid-argument cases, two
missing-context cases, and three real address failures. It also checks the W3C
HTTP and BiDi error envelopes, unchanged Classic URL, and post-failure session
liveness. The baseline was executed on 2026-08-09 with Debian Chromium
145.0.7632.116 and matching ChromeDriver 145.0.7632.117.

The script-timeout boundary has two deliberately separate groups:

- `script-timeout-chromium` is the ChromeDriver 147 oracle. A yielding async
  script times out near its deadline, while a bounded non-yielding loop first
  returns to the renderer and only then produces `script timeout`.
- `script-interrupt` is a default Moli group for the renderer-IO extension. It runs actual infinite
  loops through both Classic sync and async execution, requires timeout-driven
  `Runtime.terminateExecution` near the configured deadline, and repeats
  recovery work in the same window after every termination.

The split is intentional: the Moli group proves preemption, while the
ChromeDriver group records that ChromeDriver itself does not offer the same
non-yielding WebDriver timeout behavior.

## Coverage

  sessionStorage, IndexedDB, Selenium remote downloads via `/se/files`, frame
  switching by index/name/id/WebElement with nested parent/default-content
  recovery and relative lookup errors, deleted-frame recovery, Selenium `Select` single/multi-select
  option lookup, select/deselect, disabled/hidden option errors, form submit
  via Selenium `WebElement.submit()` and submit-button click, checkbox/radio
  selection, text input/textarea typing and clear input/change events, all-printable key input,
  text-control `change` commit on blur,
  WebDriver private-key caret navigation/PageUp/PageDown, arrow-key legacy
  `KeyboardEvent.keyCode`, selection/delete/backspace, numpad, and function-key send keys,
  direct stale element reference errors after navigation/DOM removal/document replacement, implicit waits for single and multiple
  element lookup, WebDriverWait expected
  conditions for presence/visibility/text/clickability/invisibility/staleness/
  selection/value/attribute/frame/alert, W3C keyboard actions, and explicit
  unsupported-operation errors for pointer/wheel actions including
  hover/double-click/context-click/drag-drop, Selenium remote file upload via `/se/file` with FileReader content reads,
  action key input with Shift modifiers, explicit screenshot/element screenshot and print_page unsupported errors, cookie
  management including SameSite, expired cookies, delete-all, and exact-name deletion, window handles/new/switch/close/rect/
  maximize/minimize, anchor/script popup windows, named window target reuse,
  `window.open(..., "_self")`, Selenium `ShadowRoot` lookup/scoped find/
  execute_script equality/no-such-shadow-root errors, alert/confirm/prompt text,
  and alert accept/dismiss/send keys.
- Cross-engine Selenium semantics for capability matching, same-document realm
  and WebElement identity, cross-document stale elements, top-level and popup
  storage ownership, nested frame recovery, shadow-frame Window named access,
  dialog return values, and standard W3C error classes. Each scenario uses an
  independent session and emits a structured contract record.
- Hosted local-file navigation rejection as Classic HTTP `500` with W3C
  `unknown error`, and as a BiDi `unknown error`; both retain `about:blank`, and
  the BiDi path emits no immediate or delayed navigation lifecycle event.
- Chromium/WPT navigation failure shapes: Classic HTTP `400` `invalid argument`
  envelopes for null/missing/non-string/relative/malformed URLs; BiDi `invalid
  argument` for context, URL, and wait validation; `no such frame` for missing
  context ids; `unknown error` for unsupported schemes, DNS failure, and unsafe
  ports; and a usable session after the complete failure matrix.

Known remaining worker-surface gap: the BiDi SharedWorker smoke now requires
target context creation, live realm creation, and `script.getRealms`; richer
lifecycle, error, and teardown coverage is still pending.

## Usage

Build moli first when no binary exists:

```bash
cargo build -p moli
```

Then run the default smoke:

```bash
cd moli-webdriver-smoke
uv sync
uv run moli-webdriver-smoke
```

With no `--group`, both local and CI runs execute all seven Moli groups:

```text
classic,bidi,selenium,semantics,url-policy,navigation-errors,script-interrupt
```

CI adds `--continue-on-failure` so one failing group does not hide later smoke
results. The ChromeDriver-only `script-timeout-chromium` oracle remains an
explicit external-target run.

List available groups:

```bash
uv run moli-webdriver-smoke --list-groups
```

Run focused groups:

```bash
uv run moli-webdriver-smoke --group classic
uv run moli-webdriver-smoke --group bidi
uv run moli-webdriver-smoke --group selenium
uv run moli-webdriver-smoke --group semantics --continue-on-failure
uv run moli-webdriver-smoke --group url-policy --continue-on-failure
uv run moli-webdriver-smoke --group navigation-errors --continue-on-failure
uv run moli-webdriver-smoke --group script-interrupt
MOLI_WEBDRIVER_SMOKE_GROUPS=classic,bidi,selenium uv run moli-webdriver-smoke
```

Collect all subgroup failures in one diagnostic run:

```bash
uv run moli-webdriver-smoke \
  --continue-on-failure
```

Run the same `semantics` group against a matching local Chrome/ChromeDriver
build:

```bash
~/chromium/src/out/Default/chromedriver --port=9515

uv run moli-webdriver-smoke \
  --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:9515 \
  --browser-name chrome \
  --browser-binary ~/chromium/src/out/Default/chrome \
  --group semantics --continue-on-failure
```

Run the bounded ChromeDriver script-timeout oracle against the local Chromium
147 pair:

```bash
~/chromium/src/out/Default/chromedriver --port=9515

uv run moli-webdriver-smoke \
  --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:9515 \
  --browser-name chrome \
  --browser-binary ~/chromium/src/out/Default/chrome \
  --group script-timeout-chromium
```

Run Moli's non-yielding sync/async termination contract against `moli serve`:

```bash
uv run moli-webdriver-smoke --group script-interrupt
```

Run the Chromium/WPT navigation failure matrix against any matching local
Chrome/ChromeDriver pair (the driver and browser major versions must agree):

```bash
/path/to/chromedriver-145.0.7632.117 --port=9516

uv run moli-webdriver-smoke \
  --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:9516 \
  --browser-name chrome \
  --browser-binary /usr/bin/chromium \
  --group navigation-errors
```

Useful environment variables:

- `MOLI_BIN`: path to the `moli` binary under test.
- `MOLI_WEBDRIVER_PORT`: WebDriver server port. Defaults to a free local
  port.
- `MOLI_WEBDRIVER_SMOKE_GROUPS`: comma-separated smoke group list. CLI
  `--group` takes precedence.
- `MOLI_WEBDRIVER_SMOKE_CONTINUE_ON_FAILURE=1`: equivalent to
  `--continue-on-failure`.
- `MOLI_WEBDRIVER_SMOKE_TRACE_BG=1`: print background `moli serve`
  logs.

If both debug and release binaries exist, the runner uses the newest one by file
modification time. Set `MOLI_BIN` when you need an exact binary.
